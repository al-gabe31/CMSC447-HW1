                        Hello everyone. My name is Gabe Aquino. I'm a 2nd year computer science major hoping to
                        gradaute sometime in spring 2024. I'm very excited for this class because there are
                        so many things I want to learn, software engineering being one of them

                        I was born and raised in the Philippines. I moved to the United States when I was 7
                        with my family. Adjusting to the different lifestyles was a challenge, but I
                        eventually got the hang of being an American. Personally, I'd much rather stay here
                        than visit the Philippines again. Not that I would <i>never</i> move back... just
                        not now. :)

                        I have 2 older brothers and way too many cousins (I've lost count). I'm not really
                        that close with my family, so I don't really have much to talk about. As for my
                        friends, I have 5 close ones from high school; 2 of them go to UMBC! During the
                        break, we often hangout by eating food (typically Asian) and most importantly,
                        end off the day by eating ice cream! I miss  them &lt;&#47;3

                        I don't think it's really a surprise that people like me would have video games as
                        their hobby. I know... how unoriginal. Anyway, I'm really invested into RPG games
                        like Omori and Persona 5 Royal (both of which, I'm part of the <strike>toxic</strike>
                        fandom lol). When I was younger, I used to be into Pokemon. Now, I'm just an
                        <i>observer</i> who hasn't bought any of the new games (mostly because I don't have
                        a Switch &lt;&#47;3). I might play FF7 (the remake) eventually. I also play rhythm
                        games on the side.

                        I <strong>LOVE</strong> Paramore. I listen to Paramore everyday. I've literally
                        favorited all of their songs on Spotify. If Paramore has a million fans, I'm one
                        of them. If Paramore has 5 fans, I'm one of them. If Paramore has 1 fan, that
                        one is me. If Paramore has no fans, I'm no longer alive. If the world is against
                        Paramore, I'm against the entire world. Till my last breath, I'll support Paramore
                        &lt;3. Anyway... I just generaly like punk rock (o_o;;) I also listen to KPOP
                        (unfortunate) as well as video game OST if I'm really that bored (so... all the
                        time). As for JPOP, I highly recommend Eve, YOASOBBI, and Ado. Did I ever mention
                        that I really like Paramore?

                        When I was in middle school, I got into the cross country team. Ever since up
                        until the end of sophomore year, I've been of my school's cross country and
                        track team. For track, I ran the 800m and 1600m. Despite being on the lower end of
                        the team, I still enjoyed running. I've made some friends while I ran during high
                        school. I tried keeping up with the hobby during college, but it's mostly on-and-off.

                        I've always wanted to meet new people and make new friends in college. However,
                        I've realized that I really have to put in the effort to talk to people first.
                        I'm still working on it myself and hopefully, I'll make new life long friends.

                        I genuinely <strong>LOVE</strong> baking! Unforunately, I dont' have either the
                        equipment nor money for this hobby &lt;&#47;3 Hopefully once I have a job, my
                        own apartment where I can bake, as well as the desire to bake, I can make
                        something that I really like (as well as eat it in the end :P ) Baking with
                        friends is also a plus (assuming I make new friends later on...) Some specific
                        things that I want to bake in the future are: brownies, cookies, and cupcakes.

                        I won't go too much into detail about my personal wellbeing, but I will say that
                        I do have a lot of things in my mind that I want to improve about myself. One of
                        them being my confidence. Because of my condition, it's really difficult for me
                        to just go up to somoene and start talking. Essentially, I worry too much about
                        what that person might think about me. It's been tough so far, but I think I've
                        made some progress compared to a couple years ago.

                        We spend roughly 6-8 hours a day sleeping. Could you image what I could've done during
                        that time? To clarify, I mean that sleeping just won't have to be a thing that
                        I have to do; Sleeping is no longer required. I <i>could</i> still sleep, but it'll
                        just be like any other activity, like watching TV. If I didn't had to sleep, I'd
                        probably just spend the new time I have just playing video games (I mean, what did
                        you expect?)

                        I consider myself a busy man. We often have to make the hardest choices in life such as:
                        doing our work or playing video games. Bruh! I just want to make clones of myself and
                        force them to do all of my tasks while I just sloth around as usual. Yeah... you probably
                        should have a good idea as to what type of person I am based on these first 2 wishes lol.
                        As for shared experience, why not. Whatever my clones experience, I should remember as well.
                        That'll probably backfire, but it'll at least keep things interesting.

                        moving things with my mind? Awesome! I'll probably use it to move food and close the door
                        without every having to leave the confines of my bed. With the power of never having to
                        sleep, making clones, and having telekinesis, I'd be UNSTOPPABLE!!! (until someone orders
